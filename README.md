## 🚀 About Me
I'm a tech entrepreneur and mathematician with a background in algorithm design, physics, and business development.  
I previously founded **M Y Inc.** (sold in 2025), co-founded **Pickle LLC**, and now I’m the
**Founder & CEO of SP Cloud**, a decentralized multi platform cloud and computation ecosystem (beta available at **myspcloud.com**).
Offering 95% lossless compression, smooth seamless editing, realtime collab with 5ms latency and decentralized peer-to-peer. 
Engineered with the a proprietary one of a kind optmization algorithm. 

I specialize in:
- Advanced algorithms & mathematical modeling  
- proprietary software development  
- FinTech, quantitative finance & business consulting  
- Building and scaling startups from concept to product  

I'm also pursuing studies in **Pure Mathematics** and **Finance**, all while building SP Cloud and next-gen computing technology.

## 😄 Fun (But Totally Serious) Note
I’m also a **19-year-old genius**  or at least that’s what people say when SP Cloud doesn’t crash.  
And yes… **SP Cloud is growing rapidly**, so either I'm doing something right or I'm just *very* good at looking confident :)
